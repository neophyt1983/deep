Deep is the working title for a multiplayer terminal based game. Licensing document to come. Much of the design philosophy for
this game comes from Basch-Crawl except the language of course.

The included man directory contains the beginnings of a man page that makes
reference to things that do not yet exist. Also, I'm just now learning how to
write a man page so it doesn't work correctly yet.

PDCurses 3.9 has been included for later Windows compile which I am still setting up. PDCurses is in the public domaim but not everything
in the folder is. Check the readme in the directory to make sure.

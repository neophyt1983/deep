This is the surface area of a sphere rounded down to the nearest whole number
Then sq. rooted and again rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Finally the number is rounded to the nearest 100.

This number represents the x and y axis of the initial map that is generated.

Maps generated in the world after this one are represented by 12566-(level*100)
This of course works until you get to 100 at which point you are said to be at
the core of the world and there is nowhere else to go.
